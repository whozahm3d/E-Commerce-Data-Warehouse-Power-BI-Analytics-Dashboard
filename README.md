## 🎓 Academic Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence** university course.

The objective was to design and implement a complete analytical system including:

- Data warehouse schema design (fact & dimension tables)
- End-to-end ETL and ELT workflows
- Data validation and consistency checks
- OLAP query implementation
- MOLAP pre-aggregation tables
- Performance comparison of join algorithms
- Interactive Power BI dashboard using DAX

## 🧱 System Architecture

The system follows a modern layered BI architecture:

Source Data (CSV / Raw Tables)
        │
        ▼
Staging Layer (PostgreSQL)
        │
        ▼
ETL / ELT Processing Layer
        │
        ▼
Data Warehouse (Star Schema)
        │
        ├── OLAP Queries
        ├── MOLAP Aggregation Tables
        │
        ▼
Power BI Semantic Model & Dashboard

This architecture ensures:

  - Data quality and validation
  - Analytical performance optimization
  - Scalability for future enhancements

---

## 🗃️ Data Warehouse Design

- Star schema implementation
- Fact tables: sales transactions
- Dimensions: customer, product, date
- Surrogate keys and indexing applied
- Referential integrity enforced

---

## 🔄 Data Processing Pipelines

### ETL Workflow
Transformations applied before loading into DW.

### ELT Workflow (Primary)
Raw data loaded first → transformations performed inside PostgreSQL.

Validation performed using:
- Row count checks
- Revenue reconciliation
- Aggregation verification

---

## 📊 Analytics

### OLAP
- Monthly revenue trends
- Regional performance
- Product/category analysis
- Customer metrics

### MOLAP
- Monthly summary tables for faster querying
- Monthly revenue by region
- Monthly revenue by product category
- Customer lifetime revenue summary
- Order volume by country
- Product performance rankings
- Yearly and quarterly revenue summaries

### Query Optimization & Performance Engineering
Join Techniques Analysis

- The project includes a dedicated performance evaluation of PostgreSQL join algorithms using:
  - Nested Loop Join
  - Hash Join
  - Sort-Merge Join

- Each join type was tested using EXPLAIN ANALYZE on analytical queries involving:
  - fact_sales
  - dim_customer
  - dim_product
  - dim_date

- Metrics evaluated:
  - Execution time
  - Cost estimation
  - Memory usage
  - Join order
  - Scan methods (sequential vs index scan)

This analysis helped identify the most efficient join strategy for large fact-dimension joins.

### Indexing & Performance Optimization

- To support fast analytical workloads, the following optimizations were applied:
  - Indexes on all foreign keys in the fact table
  - date_key
  - product_key
  - customer_key

- Indexes on dimension natural keys:
  - customer_id
  - stock_code
  - full_date

- Composite indexes for frequent filtering:
  - (date_key, product_key)
  - (customer_key, date_key)

- Query planner statistics maintained using:
  - ANALYZE
  - VACUUM

- These optimizations significantly reduced:
  - Full table scans
  - Query latency for dashboard visuals
  - ETL and ELT processing time

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

Includes:

- KPI cards (Revenue, Orders, ARPO, YoY Growth)
- Monthly revenue line chart
- Top regions/products bar chart
- Customer performance matrix
- Slicers & drill-down hierarchy

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- Power BI
- DAX
- ETL / ELT
- OLAP / MOLAP

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Create PostgreSQL database
2. Run scripts in order:
3. Open Power BI → Connect to PostgreSQL → Import DW tables
4. Load `dashboard.pbix`

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Incremental ETL
- Real-time data ingestion
- Partitioned fact tables
- Cloud deployment
- Automated scheduling
